# Governing AI in Mental Health: A 50-State Legislative Analysis

## Interactive Database for JMIR Mental Health Publication

This repository contains the supplementary interactive database accompanying our JMIR Mental Health publication analyzing state-level AI legislation relevant to mental health services across all 50 US states from January 2022 through May 2025.

## üìä Database Overview

From an initial review of **793 AI-related bills**, we identified and analyzed **143 bills** with potential impact on mental health AI. This searchable database allows researchers, policymakers, and clinicians to:

- **Explore legislative trends** across all 50 states
- **Identify policy gaps** in mental health AI governance  
- **Track regulatory patterns** using our taxonomy system
- **Filter bills** across 25 distinct policy dimensions
- **Access direct links** to full bill text on LegiScan

## üîç Key Features

### Four-Tier Taxonomy System

| Code | Category | Definition | Inclusion Criteria |
|------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **E** | Explicit | Bills that explicitly reference mental health, behavioral health, psychotherapy, or related services in the context of AI development, regulation, or application | The bill directly names mental health uses of AI, specific clinical applications, or mental health contexts as targets of regulation, policy, or oversight |
| **SR** | Substantively Relevant | Bills that govern MH-AI in ways that have direct, foreseeable implications for mental health services or stakeholders, even if mental health is not explicitly or substantively discussed in the bill's text | The bill regulates MH-AI in a way that predictably impacts mental health uses, delivery, or providers, regardless of whether mental health is explicitly mentioned |
| **II** | Incidentally Implicative | Bills that are broadly written and might include MH-AI, but only in a general or indirect way. Clinical impact is uncertain or minimal | MH-AI falls or could fall under the bill's scope, but direct mechanisms or practical effects at the clinical level are not apparent or minimal |
| **CB** | Companion Bill | Bills that are companion legislation to other bills in the dataset | The bill is a companion to another bill, typically in a different chamber of the legislature |
| **NR** | Not Relevant | Bills with no meaningful relationship to MH-AI services, even under expansive interpretations | The bill does not touch on mental health services |

### 25 Policy Dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Civil Penalties** | Applies any kind of civil penalty to violators (e.g., non-criminal penalties such as system suspension, civil fines, creation of private right-of-action to sue, profit disgorgement, suspension of noncompliant systems, punitive monitoring, or application of a separate civil enforcement statute) |
| **Criminal Penalties** | Applies any kind of criminal penalty to violators (e.g., criminal fines, incarceration, misdemeanor/felony designations) |
| **Licensing Board Oversight** | Applies any kind of oversight by state professional licensing boards (e.g., requiring board approval of MH-AI systems used in diagnosis/treatment or allowing boards to discipline individuals or systems) |
| **Disclosure/Consent** | Implements any requirement to disclose use or features of the AI system (including disclaimers) and/or consent to the use of such systems/features or the ability to revoke consent |
| **Discrimination/Bias** | Implements any requirement regarding discrimination, bias, or fairness |
| **Risk Classification** | Implements or defines the scope of the law by a risk classification system (e.g., "high risk" AI system, consequential decisions, and similar frameworks) |
| **Data Protection** | Implements any requirements for data privacy, data security, or data retention/deletion (e.g., encryption requirements, secure storage, or data purging policies) |
| **Prescribing** | Applies any requirements or waivers regarding prescriptions |
| **Practitioner Responsibilities** | Applies any kind of requirements on practitioners‚Äîor waivers or exemptions‚Äîrelated to their use of AI systems |
| **Monitoring** | Applies any kind of monitoring requirements for MH-AI (e.g., live supervision, submission to audits/documentation processes, generation of reports, or post-market surveillance) |
| **Research** | Pertains to or would affect mental health research (e.g., data collection, consent requirements, ethical guidelines, exemptions for legitimate research use, etc.) |
| **Consumer Protection** | Provisions concerning fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive use of MH-AI systems, including in advertising |
| **Payments/Insurance** | Regulations on insurance coverage, reimbursement, and payment models |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Explicitly requires a human to monitor, approve, or participate in an essential part of the provision of the MH-AI service |
| **Pre-Market Review** | Implements requirements for any level of regulatory review prior to the AI product being offered/implemented (e.g., state commission approval, FDA approval, submission of risk assessments, etc.) |
| **Post-Market Review** | Implements requirements for any level of scheduled/routine review after the AI product has been marketed/implemented (e.g., post-market surveillance, auditing, risk assessments, efficacy reviews, etc.), subject to regulatory oversight |
| **Transparency** | Implements requirements involving public or patient rights to access AI system data (e.g., requests to obtain data, public inventories of AI systems, publication or transparency requirements) |
| **Opt Out** | Provides for the ability to opt out of AI services in favor of receiving equivalent human-delivered health services |
| **Pilot/Sandbox** | Provides for regulatory pilot programs or sandbox systems, allowing AI products to be tested and receive feedback from regulators prior to full marketing |
| **Malpractice/Liability** | Pertains to medical malpractice involving AI, including liability allocation for AI-related harm (e.g., standards of evidence, assigning responsibility to deployers, developers, practitioners, or manufacturers, liability shields or limitations, use of MH-AI records and data in litigation, etc.) |
| **Event Reporting** | Creates a system for reporting adverse events, near misses, or other safety events involving MH-AI |
| **Vulnerable Populations** | Creates any responsibilities related to vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, children, disabled, foreign-language speakers, etc.), such as mandated reporting requirements, accessibility requirements, or parental controls |
| **Meta/Biometric Data** | Regulates biometric data, behavioral data, or metadata used by MH-AI systems |
| **Special Purpose Entities** | Creates or assigns committees, subcommittees, task forces, or similar special-purpose bodies pertaining to MH-AI |
| **Safety Standards** | Pertains to safety standards for MH-AI (e.g., human overrides, emergency protocols, or prohibitions on high-risk uses) or safety-based exceptions to other requirements (e.g., bypassing procedures when delays risk harm, allowing immediate protective actions) |
